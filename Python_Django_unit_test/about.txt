unit testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing 
indivisual units or components of a softwre 

A unit refers to the smallest testable part of the system , such as function,
method or class

the goal of unit testing is to verify the correctness of these indivisual 
unit in isolation, ensuring, that they work as intended.

Python libraries for unit testing - pytest, unittest

Benefit of unit testing :
unit test help identify bugs or issues in the early stages of development, 
making it esier and less costly to fix them.

Which module Django use for unit testing:
The testing framework in Django is based on the python unitest module, which is 
part of the python library

How unit test performs in Django:

0. In django, the python manage.py test command is used to run tests for your Django
project. It is a management command that triggers the test runner provide by Django.

1. Django looks for a file/package named tests within your project directory. This 
package typically contains python files with names starting test_ or ending 
with _test, as per Django's default test discovery rules. 

2. Django collect all the test cases from the test folder and subfolder.Test cases 
are defined as a subclass of the django.test.TestCase class or any test cases related 
classes provided by the django.

3. Django set up a test environment for running the test. It creates a seperate 
database, often referred to as the test database, to isolate the test data from 
your production database. It also applies migrations to the test database to provide a 
consistent starting point for the test.

4. during the test execution, Django provides various assertion methos 
(eg: assertEqual, assertTrue) that you can use to verify the expected behaviour 
of your code.
